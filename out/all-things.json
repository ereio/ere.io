Thick, like biting into a chocolate bar but without melting. A cross between a dessert and a snack for those who like cheese. 10/10\\n\\n### Kerrygold Dubliner w/ Irish Stout\\n   - This is actually a dessert. Sharp, crumbly but melts in your mouth. The stout hits seconds after the creaminess of the dubliner. A wild transition of flavor, but can be overwhelming. Akin to a triple chocolate cake.

If I can find commonly found, reactive features available in pure css/html, I'll place them here. Also a few failed efforts.\\n\\n## Pure CSS Search\\n\\n#### 1. ~~Matching on value attribute from ```<input/>```~~\\n\\n- attempt to narrow a list of items by autocomplete searching and using attribute selectors (likely input[value~=\\\"\\\"]\\n- content can move [from CSS to HTML](https://css-tricks.com/css-attr-function-got-nothin-custom-properties) just not from HTML to CSS as [it was removed from the spec](https://www.w3.org/TR/selectors-3/#content-selectors). it's also ironically placed under section 6.6.6. \\n- ```value=\\\"\\\"```'s are added to inputs within react and other frontend frameworks, so the ability to match on an updated value attribute is lost. I originally thought this was inherent in html input elements\\n  -  Side note, [CSS keyloggers rely on javascript](https://www.bram.us/2018/02/21/css-keylogger-and-why-you-shouldnt-worry-about-it/) and technically do not work in non-javascript environments\\n\\n- note that ```<details>``` toggles an open attribute on the element when clicked. If an html element would allow content to be added on a mouse down, you could set an input tags value without javascript, or just remove all but the selected\\n\\n#### 2. ~~Using the content of a ```<div contenteditable=\\\"true\\\" />```~~\\n\\n- still not an attribute, content is still not selectable even if [editable](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/HTML/Editable_content)\\n- the answer might be found with [other global attributes](https://www.w3schools.com/tags/ref_standardattributes.asp)\\n\\n\\n#### 3. ~~Using ```<datalist>``` to autocomplete ```<options/>``` on an ```<input/>```~~\\n\\n- the killer here is really the same as above. You can autocomplete and technically sub-string 'search' terms based on the native implementation of an ```<inputs list=\\\"whatever\\\"/>```\\n- the problem is after you select an option, no attribute is set in the html.\\n- further more, you [cannot style](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/7208786/how-to-style-the-option-of-an-html-select-element) or [manipulate options](https://github.com/w3c/csswg-drafts/issues/2013) you've created for the dataset in the actual options list because the functionality is handled natively. I attempted setting ```<dataset style=\\\"position: absolute;\\\"/>``` and was hoping the static list (assuming it was the same when auto-completing) would start to disappear\\n\\n#### 4. ~~Form submit allowing autocompleted value to be submitted as the slug~~\\n - we can substring search the ```<options />```, but we can't reduce the list of options after search. Fine.\\n - can we at least utilize the search result with a form?\\n - it's either a query param or a POST that has a body\\n\\n#### 5. ~~Submit query params and pull them into css~~\\n - It's not really possible, but i'd have to **whole css file** [for each matching 'thing'](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/23816060/is-it-possible-to-pass-parameters-to-css-file)\\n\\n#### 5.

The moment I started doing anything more complicated it would crash, most of the time ending up in a kernel panic / boot loop. \\n\\nSeveral things would kick this off: a tethered android device on one of the few usb ports left or dropping the ESSID of one of the access points. One time it was as small as changing one the AP LEDs config. That one hurt the most. It wouldn't be just making changes in general either, as I changed the SSIDs and passwords frequently. It usually involved changing the way the hardware would interact. After 4 years, I'm tired of having to wipe clean and start again because it was less trouble than figuring out how to change it on the disk while off.\\n\\nI built up quite a bit of resources I would like to offload just in case:\\n﻿\\n```\\nopkg update\\n\\n# install realtek drivers and allow usb forwarding\\nopkg update\\nopkg install kmod-rt2800-lib kmod-rt2800-usb kmod-rt2x00-lib kmod-rt2x00-usb\\nopkg install kmod-usb-net-rtl8152\\n\\n# install usb tethering drivers\\nopkg install kmod-usb-net kmod-usb-net-rndis kmod-usb-net-cdc-ether\\n\\n# install openvpn\\nopkg install openvpn-openssl luci-app-openvpn openssl-util\\n\\n# install\\nreboot\\n```\\n\\n#### [Changing the TTL to spoof cell traffic](https://www.linuxtopia.org/Linux_Firewall_iptables/x4799.html) \\n#### [More TTL examples in DD-WRT docs](https://wiki.dd-wrt.com/wiki/index.php/Iptables#Modifying_the_TTL)\\n#### [Installing necessary RT drivers on openwrt](https://forum.openwrt.org/t/how-install-rtl8812au-driver-on-raspberry-pi-3-with-lede/4093/3)\\n#### [Installing Other RT drivers](https://forum.openwrt.org/t/raspberry-3-lan-wan-help-needed/1377/7)\\n\\nI have an instruction set I'll list out here with time. \\n\\nAll in all,  the ease of use LuCI interface + hardware resource efficiency was really nice to have.

Situational constraints typically predict behavior far better than personality, intelligence, or other individual-level traits.\\n\\nShe states its better to response to a persons ineffective behavior with curiosity rather than judgement. Author learned this as a result of talking with Kimberly Longhofer, a writer on accommodation for homelessness.\\n\\nSummary of example is that one who is homeless may buy alcohol because the nights are cold, the world is unfriendly to them and they are uncomfortable in that cold. Alcohol is one of the most accessible tools available compared to help from others around them and a warm bed.\\n\\n> In that chronically uncomfortable, over-stimulating context, needing a drink or some cigarettes makes fucking sense.\\n>\\n> If a person’s behavior doesn’t make sense to you, it is because you are missing a part of their context. It’s that simple.\\n\\nProcrastination is much the same problem and has a handful of origins:\\n\\n1. Anxiety about their attempts not being \\\"good enough\\\"\\n2. Confusion about what the next steps are\\n3. The task is meaningful and cares about doing it well\\n\\nSeveral of those apply to my current progress on Tethor and I often don't work on it if I'm not feeling well slept and ready. If goals, and the process to obtain those goals are established, it's much easier to work towards them. The author uses her dissertation as an example where she had her process and time allotted was not **unknown**.\\n\\nIt reminds me a lot of the unknowns in *product development*\\n\\nWhen developers burn out it's often due to unknowns or lack of passion of the product. Not knowing the direction of where the product is headed or its purpose does not inspire confidence to work toward the goal.\\n\\n> If a person can’t get out of bed, something is making them exhausted. If a student isn’t writing papers, there’s some aspect of the assignment that they can’t do without help. If an employee misses deadlines constantly, something is making organization and deadline-meeting difficult. Even if a person is actively choosing to self-sabotage, there’s a reason for it — some fear they’re working through, some need not being met, a lack of self-esteem being expressed.\\n\\n## [Friendships](#friendships)\\n\\n#### [(Article) Why We're Better Off With Fewer Friends](https://getpocket.com/explore/item/why-we-re-better-off-with-fewer-friends?utm_source=pocket-newtab)\\n\\n[Dunbar's Number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunbar's_number)\\n\\n150 was the main focus, as it's the average cognitive limit  of friendships with whom one can maintain stable social relationships.

Organizing your files by domain (or feature), instead of by function, allows your code to mirror the UI/UX and act as a virtual map of features\\n\\n```\\n── app (or src)\\n   ├── assets\\n   ├── global\\n   ├── libs\\n   ├── store\\n   ├── views\\n   └── index.js\\n```\\n\\nFor example, it's your first day at a new startup. Imagine you knew next to nothing about the project you're working on other than that you have users and they manage cooking recipes in the project. A manager asks you to \\\"change the profile section to look like facebook\\\". Which file structure would help you get started the fastest? \\n\\n### By Domain\\n\\n```\\n── app (or src)\\n   ├── assets\\n   ├── global\\n   ├── libs\\n   ├── store\\n   │   ├── auth \\n   │   ├── recipes \\n   │   ├── settings \\n   │   └── user \\n   │       ├── actions.js \\n   │       ├── reducer.js \\n   │       └── state.js \\n   ├── views\\n   │   ├── recipes \\n   │   └── user \\n   │       ├── profile\\n   │       │   └── index.js (*)\\n   │       └── index.js \\n   └── index.js\\n``` \\n\\n### By Function (Type)\\n```\\n── app (or src)\\n   ├── assets\\n   ├── styles\\n   ├── utils\\n   ├── components\\n   │   └── user \\n   │       ├── UserComponent.js\\n   │       └── profile\\n   │           └── UserProfileComponent.js\\n   ├── pages\\n   │   └── user\\n   │       └── profile\\n   │           └── ProfilePage.js\\n   ├── routes\\n   │   └── user\\n   │       └── profile\\n   │           └── UserRoute.js\\n   ├── redux\\n   ├── index.android.js\\n   ├── index.ios.js \\n   ...\\n``` \\n\\nWhile preference is subjective, I've onboarded new team members on projects with both, but I've had them deploying faster when structuring 'by domain'.\\n\\nOffloading the cognitive map of the project to the file structure prevents developers from relying solely on UML or diagrams that structure the flow of the project. The file structure acts as a map to the UI and even the domain logic contained within. You may have observed that the ```by domain``` example seemingly has a top layer of ```by function``` structure. Viewing the project with higher architectural scope allows you to view the 'store' and 'views' as feature sets. Many projects do not have explicit UI/UX (CLI tools or API's) or use a 'store' for handling immutable state (potentially API's). Instead, they may be labeled as 'output' but still contain a 'store' to manage state.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## UI Libraries\\n\\n### [react-native-paper](https://callstack.github.io/react-native-paper/getting-started.html) \\n   -
