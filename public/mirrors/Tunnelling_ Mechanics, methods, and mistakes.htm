<center><p><b>Introduction</b> </p></center>

<p>A tunnel is a long, narrow, essentially linear excavated underground
opening, the length of which greatly exceeds its width or height. (Walhstrom,
1973). In contrast, a cavern is an underground opening whoselength and
width are roughly similar. These two types of excavations are end-members,
and every underground excavation undertaken by mankind can be looked upon
as a combination of the two. A shaft can simply be thought of as a tunnel
which is vertical rather than horizontal. </p>

<p>For centuries, mankind has excavated caverns and tunnels in the earth
for a myriad of uses. Historically, early man probably dug tunnels and
caves for shelter, or to store food that had been killed or gathered. There
is evidence that Stone Age people sank shafts and drove tunnels in order
to obtain flint for bladed tools. (Wahlstrom, 1973) Later, as mankind developed
the ability to make metal tools, the need to go underground for raw materials
also developed, and more tunnels were dug. Early excavations in metal-bearing
ores have been identified in Caucasia, near the Black Sea, which date back
to about 3500 B.C. (Wahlstrom, 1973) Tunnels were built in ancient times
by nearly every great civilization: Aztec, Inca, Babylonian, Egyptian,
and Persian. The tools used in tunneling were the tools of the age: Bone,
antler, flint and wood to the early humans, bronze, iron, and steel as
civilization advanced. For centuries, tunnels in rock were driven by building
fires against the rock faces, which would cause expansion and spalling,
often accelerated by dousing the hot rock with water, then picking the
fractured rock away with picks and wedges (Wahlstrom, 1973). Egyptian and
Roman mines were worked to depths of approximately 200 meters. (Mahtab
and Grasso) By the 6<sup>th</sup> century B.C., it has been estimated that
the advance rate of a hand-worked tunnel in hard rock was perhaps 9 meters
per year. (Beall, 1973) Today, nearly three thousand years later, the advance
rate in a given excavation is increased over that by two or three orders
of magnitude. (Mahtab and Grasso, 1992) The advent of explosives, first
black powder, then nitroglycerine and dynamite, issued in a new age of
excavation. Not just have the rates of excavation improved, however. Through
improved methods of design and construction, the dimensions of underground
workings have increased, and the modern underground worker can count on
much greater safety and much better working conditions than an historical
counterpart. With improvements in design and construction, the diversity
of use has also widened, and tunnels are not simply the mines and shelters
they used to be. Today, the human race excavates for transportation, mining,
storage, defense, deposition of waste, and the list goes on. The primitive
picks and wedges of the past have given way to the mechanized excavating
tools, pneumatic drills, and sophisticated blasting methods. </p>

<p>The process of digging a tunnel in rock, however, is not simply a case
of deciding where the tunnel is to go and then blasting one's way through.
Rock is a very treacherous medium through which to travel. Even "solid"
rock often contains innumerable cracks, faults, folds, and discontinuities,
the activation of any of which may become a trigger to a collapse of the
tunnel. The design and construction of a tunnel must account for the mechanical
properties of the surrounding rock, which includes not only the aforementioned
cracks and discontinuities, but also the weathering and deterioration of
the rock, the number and type of layers in the rock, strike and dip of
these layers, underground water level, overburden, and the list goes on
and on. (Matsumoto and Nishioka, 1991) For this reason, the principles
of mechanics are used to determine the feasibility, methods of design and
construction, and the stability of the tunnel once it is excavated. </p>

<p>Tunneling is one of the most hazardous projects in engineering and construction.
It is also one of the most expensive. For this reason, extensive planning
and surveying goes into the pre-excavation stage of the project. Many years
often pass between the initial idea and the beginning of the excavation.
Figure 1, taken from Mahtab and Grasso (1992), is a flowchart showing the
general sequence of activities undertaken in tunnel design and construction.<br>

<center><p><b>Primary Concerns</b> </p></center>

<p>First and foremost, there exist a number of general uncertainties and
unknowns when dealing with the underground. These variables can range from
minor inconveniences to major challenges to the designers of the tunnel.
A short list of some of these concerns consists of: (Bickel, et al, 1996)
</p>

<ul>
<p>1. The overriding uncertainty when dealing with any underground project.
<br>
2. The geology of the area will determine the feasibility and the cost
of the undertaking. <br>
3. Engineering properties of rock may change, sometimes drastically,with
a wide range of conditions, notably time, season, rate and direction of
loading.<br>
4. Groundwater is the most difficult parameter to predict and the most
troublesome during construction. <br>
5. Drilling core, the most common method of determining underground conditions,
only recovers less than 0.0005% of the excavated volume of the tunnel on
a typical project in the most exhaustive survey, which leaves a great deal
of room for uncertainty. </p>
</ul>

<center><p><b>Site Characterization</b> </p></center>

<p>Once the designers of the tunnel get down to the actual design phase,
the first activity usually performed is a characterization of the site
of the excavation. This involves characterizing the rock mass into which
the tunnel is to be driven. This characterization will include the following
properties: (Mahtab and Grasso, 1992) </p>

<ul>
<p>1. Topography of the area, the climate and the accessibility of the
area.<br>
2. Location of the cavity with respect to the ground surface and rock formation
boundaries. <br>
3. Structural stability of the rock body, which is a function of seismisity,
faults, and stress concentrations. <br>
4. Hydrologic regime and its perturbation, which is a function of the permeability
of the ground and the ground water flow rates. <br>
5. Potential for subsidence and other surface effects. <br>
6. Rock types in the rock mass, their genesis and their homogeneity. <br>
7. Degree of weathering and weatherability of the rock. <br>
8. Geologic discontinuities and other defects. <br>
9. Deformability characteristics under short- and long-term loading. <br>
10. Strength characteristics in reference to a rational failure criterion.
<br>
11. In-situ stress and hydraulic and/or dynamic loads. <br>
12. Geometric and mechanical properties of systematic and extensive discontinuities.
</p>

<center><p><b>Rock Mass Characterization </b></p></center>
</ul>

<p>Put quite simply, the most important requirement that rock must fulfill
when excavated is its ability to remain stable. Although this sounds simple,
it is not always the case. Mahtab and Grasso (1992) define the term "rock
mass" as the rock fabric and all the joints it contains. It is very
important to consider the joints and cracks in a rock because, as mentioned
before, these discontinuities can serve as a point of failure in a rock
mass under stress. </p>

<p>Testing of the rocks in the area being considered for excavation is
not always straightforward. There are a number of method for testing the
rocks, both to determine the in-situ stress on the rock, as well as the
rock's ability to withstand this stress. This second part often involves
uniaxial and triaxial compression tests to determine the "strength"
of the rock.</p>

<p>Tunnel engineers generally classify rocks on the basis of resistance
to deformation (strength), amount of weathering, and general resistance
to weathering. (Parker, 1996) These last two are not the same, although
they may seem so at first glance. A rock may be very resistant to weathering,
but may have also have been subjected to a very long period of time, which
may result in significant weathering. In general, the strength and resistance
to weathering of a rock is derived from the class of rock. Igneous and
metamorphic rocks, in general, are more resistant to deformation and weathering
than sedimentary rocks. </p>

<p>Although the classifications in these two tables are quite simple, the
descriptions of rock masses can be extremely complex, and are much more
so than for soils. The reason for this is that, although rocks have a greater
innate strength than a soil, their mechanical characteristics are dominated
by the effect of anisotropy (the state of a characteristic of the rock
being different in different directions) and the discontinuities contained
within. These discontinuities may range from foliation in the rock , such
as the layering in a schist or the fissibility of a shale. The discontinuities
may also take the form of fractures, ranging from the minuscule cracks
to major faulting. (Parker, 1996) </p>

<p>Few tunnels are excavated without the use of some kind of artificial
support. Terzaghi (1946) developed a classification scheme to describe
rocks and their load on steel supports. Although this classification scheme
is fifty years old, and is limited with today's technology, the classification
scheme it is still quite useful for basic descriptions. Terzaghi's seven
rock mass descriptions are as follows: (Terzaghi, 1946) </p>

<p><b>Intact rock:</b> Intact rock contains neither joints nor hair cracks,
and thus breaks across sound rock. Spalling conditions, which is when thin
slabs of rock fall off the roof or walls of the tunnel, , and popping conditions,
where rock slabs on the sides or roof of the tunnel spontaneously and violently
detach, may occur for several hours or days after blasting. </p>

<p><b>Stratified rock:</b> Stratified rock consists of individual strata
with little or no resistance against separation along strata boundaries.
Spalling conditions are quite common. </p>

<p><b>Moderately jointed rock:</b> Moderately jointed rock contains joints
and hair cracks, but blocks between the joints are locally grown together
or so intimately interlocked that vertical walls do not require lateral
support. Again, spalling and popping conditions may be encountered. </p>

<p><b>Blocky and seamy rock:</b> This consists of chemically intact or
nearly intact rock fragments which are entirely separated from each other
and imperfectly interlocked. The vertical walls of the tunnel may require
support. </p>

<p><b>Crushed rock:</b> Crushed rock is chemically intact, but extensively
fractured. If the crushed rock is small-grained and below the water table,
it will exhibit the properties of a water-bearing sand. </p>

<p><b>Squeezing rock:</b> Squeezing rock slowly advances into the tunnel
without a perceptible volume increase. This condition requires a very high
percentage of microscopic and submicroscopic micaceous minerals or clay
minerals with a low swelling capacity. </p>

<p><b>Swelling rock:</b> Swelling rock advances into the tunnel primarily
by the expansion of the rock itself. This condition seems to be limited
to rocks containing clays, such as montmorillonite, which have a high capacity
to swell when hydrated. </p>

<p>Rock mass classification schemes abound, and nearly every different
author has a different method of classifying rock masses for excavation
purposes</p>

<center><p><b>Tunnel Geometry</b> </p></center>

<p>In the design of tunnels, designers attempt to utilize a shape that
will prove the most stable. Basic mechanics, in conjunction with the rock
mass classification, dictates the most effective geometry. For instance,
tunnels are rarely excavated with a flat roof. The reason for this is that,
as the span increases, the rock in the center has less force holding it
up, and a flat-roofed tunnel is more susceptible to collapse. However,
when tunnelling is strongly stratified rock, such as shale, the roof is
often cut flat, taking advantage of the rock's natural tendency to break
along bedding planes. By cutting the tunnel along bedding planes and then
supporting the roof, the tunnel would be less apt to collapse than if a
different geometry were employed which cut across the bedding of the rock,
making it more unstable. (Wahlstrom, 1973) For the most part, however,
tunnels are excavated with roofs that are circular segments, which is the
most stable geometric shape with regard to an externally-applied stress.
Also common are tunnels cut with horseshoe shapes, or tunnels with gothic
arch roofs, which provide maximum stability in the roof section. (Wahlstrom,
1973) </p>

<center><p><a href="http://www-personal.umich.edu/~stmarie/tunnel.gif">For
a sketch of some various tunnel shapes, click here</a></p></center>

<p>In addition to the shape of the tunnel section, the size is also very
important. It is generally considered that the minimum size for a tunnel
that will still permit reasonable working space is at least 7 feet (2.15
m) high by 4 feet (1.2 m) wide, clear of the wall or the supports, for
a walkway. (Wahlstrom, 1973) For obvious reasons, any tunnel designed for
vehicle traffic would have to be larger. The primary problem in sizing
a tunnel is one of support against external stress. Consider circular tunnels:
Using the formula of (pi)r<sup>2</sup> to calculate the area of a circle
(or in this case, an infinitesimally thin slice through a circular tunnel),
it can be shown that doubling the diameter (2r) of a circular tunnel results
in four times the area (2r) of the slice. This means that doubling the
diameter of a tunnel requires removing four times as much rock. This rock,
up to the point of excavation, had been in equilibrium with the surrounding
rock, and had been supporting it. In addition, the surface area of the
tunnel is doubled, and so the forces in the rock which are trying to bring
down the tunnel are now acting over twice as large an area. It is for this
reason that the use of supports is much more important in larger tunnels
than in smaller ones. Often, in cases where tunnels are to be driven into
rock of questionable competence, very small tunnels are driven first and
then carefully enlarged and supported during the enlarging process. (Wahlstrom,
1973) <br>
<br>
<b>The Mechanics of it all</b> </p>

<p>First of all, it is not possible to cover all of the mechanics of tunnel
design and construction in a short paper. Dozens of books hundreds of pages
long have been devoted to this. However, there are a few basic concepts
which apply to the design process, and I will cover those, then a brief
description of the tunnel design process itself.. </p>

<p>The two concepts in mechanics which most apply to tunnelling are stress
and strain. Stress may simply be thought of as a force applied on a body,
and strain may simply be thought of as that body's deformational response
to the stress. For instance, consider placing a heavy book on top of a
grape. The stress is the force of gravity and the mass of the book, and
the strain is the reaction of the grape to the stress, namely, flattening.
Staining of the book by the grape juice is a chemical process, and is not
considered in this paper. Stress and strain models are used by most tunnel
engineers to determine the feasibility of a particular excavation. However,
recent models have begun to move away from a stress-and-strain focus. The
focus of some of the newer models is the distortional strain energy stored
in the rock masses. The reason for this is that energy is a scalar, and
thus has no direction, so that the analysis may be performed without regard
to the directions of the stress and strain acting on the rock body. (Matsumoto
and Nishioka, 1991) However, this paper will not go into the discussion
of these methods, primarily because they have not been tested to the extent
of the classical mechanics models, and also because the author has difficulty
understanding them. </p>

<p>In the consideration of stress and strain, the dynamic nature of a material
can be put into three classes of ideal behavior, and all real materials
behave in some combination of the three. </p>

<p>1. Hookian solid-body (elastic) behavior: In elastic behavior, the strain
is completely proportional to the stress applied, so that a plot of stress
vs. strain yields a straight line. </p>

<p>2. St. Venant's solid-body (plastic) behavior: In plastic behavior,
an applied stress will not result in any strain until a certain stress
is reached (yield point). At this point, only strain increases. Reduction
of the stress to below the yield stress will result in the cessation of
the strain. </p>

<p>3. Newtonian liquid (viscous) behavior: In viscous behavior, the rate
of strain is proportional to the stress applied. That is, as the stress
applied increases, the deformation does not increase, but the rate at which
the body deforms does. </p>

<center><p><a href="http://www-personal.umich.edu/~stmarie/crop.gif">For
graphs, click here</a></p></center>

<p>With respect to these three ideals, no rock behaves perfectly in these
manners, but rather in some combination of elastic, plastic, and viscous.
A potentially important quality of some materials, notably glasses, is
fragility. A material exhibiting fragile behavior will shatter while still
in the range of elasticity. (Matsumoto and Nishioka, 1991). However, many
materials which would normally behave in a fragile manner while being compressed
from one direction will flow in a ductile manner when compressed from all
three directions. (Matsumoto and Nishioka, 1991) </p>

<p>The term "rock strength" is comprised of a number of different
types of properties. Rocks are often tested for strength by use of a uniaxial
compression test, in which a cylinder of rock is placed in a vise and compressed
along its length. This is a measure of compressive strength. Other tests
may measure tensile strength (the rock's ability to withstand being pulled
apart), flexural strength (the ability to withstand bending), unconfined
shear strength (the rock's ability to withstand being cut in two), or triaxial
compressive strength. In triaxial compression tests, the rock is confined
in a pressurized fluid, which compresses it, imitating the confining pressure
of rock at depth. In these triaxial tests, the failure pressure of the
rock is normally quite higher than under uniaxial stress. During the triaxial
compression test, if even a slight sideways pressure is imposed on the
rock, a shear failure occurs. (Matsumoto and Nishioka,1991) The greater
the confining pressure on the sides, the greater the maximum stress at
failure, and the less failure that will occur. One curious phenomenon in
some rocks is that of strain hardening. Certain plastic or ductile materials
may, when subjected to a certain degree of deformation, develop increasing
strength. This is occasionally observed in underground openings, especially
when plastic rocks with low initial strength become stiffer and more resistant
to strain dislocation after a period of time (Wahlstrom, 1973) </p>

<p>Rocks around a tunnel are considered to be under triaxial compression.
This leads to a very dangerous problem: If the rocks are under triaxial
compression, and the confining rock on one side is removed as the tunnel
is driven, there will exist a severe stress gradient on the rocks. The
rocks which make up the tunnel wall and roof will be subjected to high
stresses on the one side, but the counteracting force is no longer present,
as those rocks are no longer present. This situation can, in deep mines,
lead to rock bursts, where large portions of the tunnel walls can suddenly
and violently explode in seismic events which are often measured at -2
to 4 on the Richter scale (Jha and Chouhan, 1994) </p>

<p>So where does this bring us? The actual three-dimensional mathematical
modeling of the design of a tunnel is a very complicated process, involving
a fair amount of differential equations. For instance, a three-dimensional
model would contain the three normal strains, the three shear strains,
the three normal stresses, the three shear stresses, and the three deformations
or displacements measured in Cartesian space. These fifteen unknowns can
translate into 36 elastic constants. (Mahtab and Grasso, 1992) However,
by making a very simple assumption, it is possible to use a two-dimensional
mathematical model, which greatly simplifies the process and works quite
well. The basic assumption made is that all the stresses involved are either
in or parallel to the plane of interest (xy, for example). There are a
number of different solutions out there, but a good number of them make
use of the following assumptions: (from Mahtab and Grasso, 1991) <br>
<br>
1. stress<sub>z </sub>=shear strain<sub>xz </sub>= shear strain<sub>yz
</sub>= 0 <br>
normal strain<sub>z </sub>=0 <br>
where the subscript denotes the direction of stress or strain</p>

<p>The inverse Hooke's law (strain-stress relations) are derived and are:
</p>

<ul>
<p>normal strain<sub>x </sub>= 1/E(stress<sub>x</sub>-PR*stress<sub>y</sub>)
<br>
normal strain<sub>y </sub>= 1/E(stress<sub>y</sub>-PR*stress<sub>x</sub>)
<br>
shear strain<sub>xy </sub>= shear stress<sub>xy</sub>/G <br>
normal strain<sub>z</sub> = (-PR/E)(stress<sub>x</sub>+stress<sub>y</sub>)
</p>

<p>where:<br>
<br>
PR is the Poisson's ratio (ratio of contraction and expansion = -epsilon<sub>1</sub>/epsilon<sub>3</sub>
<br>
E is the Young's modulus (ratio of stress and strain = sigma/epsilon) <br>
G = E/2(1+PR), which is one of the Lamé constants. </p>
</ul>

<p>The Hooke's Law for plane stress is given by the inversion of the above
equations: </p>

<ul>
<p>stress<sub>x </sub>= (E/1-PR<sup>2</sup>)(strain<sub>x</sub>+PR*strain<sub>y</sub>)<br>
stress<sub>y </sub>= (E/1-PR<sup>2</sup>)(strain<sub>y</sub>+PR*strain<sub>x</sub>)
<br>
shear stress<sub>xy </sub>= G*shear strain<sub>xy</sub> </p>
</ul>

<p>Plane strain can be illustrated by a long, cylindrical opening, which
is conveniently what a tunnel is. If z represents the axis of the opening,
the displacements of all the points in the plane of the cross-section (x-y)
plane are not zero, but the shear strains </p>

<p>associated with the z direction are zero (shear strain<sub>yz</sub>
=shear strain<sub>zx</sub> = 0) and strain<sub>z</sub> must be constant
(and is usually set equal to zero for convenience). With the conditions
thus, the Hooke's Law becomes: </p>

<ul>
<p>stress<sub>x</sub> = (L + 2G)strain<sub>x</sub>+L*strain<sub>y</sub>
<br>
stress<sub>y</sub> = (L + 2G)strain<sub>y</sub>+L*strain<sub>x<br>
</sub>shear stress<sub>xy</sub> = G*shear strain<sub>xy </sub></p>
</ul>

<ul>
<p>where:<br>
G = E/[2(1+nu)] <br>
L= PR*E/(1+PR)(1-2PR), which is the second Lamé constant </p>
</ul>

<p>As a result, the stress in the z direction (the constrained slice of
tunnel) is given by: </p>

<ul>
<p>stress<sub>z</sub> = PR(stress<sub>x</sub>+stress<sub>y</sub>)<br>
</p>
</ul>

<p>And, for the strain-stress relations for plane strain, we have: </p>

<ul>
<p>strain<sub>x</sub> = 1/E[(1-PR<sup>2</sup>)stress<sub>x</sub> -PR(1
-PR)stress<sub>y</sub>] <br>
epsilon<sub>y</sub> = 1/E[(1-PR<sup>2</sup>)stress<sub>y</sub> -PR(1-PR)stress<sub>x</sub>]
<br>
shear strain<sub>xy</sub> =shear stress<sub>xy</sub>/G </p>
</ul>

<p>Thus, using the above equations, in conjunction with rock mechanics
testing and perhaps in-situ testing of the stress conditions underground,
the tunnel engineer could approximate the existing stresses on the rocks
at depth, and can estimate the potential strains which may result from
excavating a tunnel. From these, the engineer can determine the following:
</p>

<ul>
<p>1. The feasibility of the project, given the rocks' potential to remain
competent.<br>
2. The costs of the project, in terms of time, labor, and structural support.<br>
3. The type and amount of artificial support needed for stability.<br>
4. The optimum geometry for the tunnel, based on rock qualities.</p>

<center><p><b>Problems</b></p></center>
</ul>

<p>These equations, are theoretical. Nature, unfortunately, has an ability
to and a habit of throwing kinks into well-laid plans. This section will
demonstrate a number of difficulties associated with excavation.</p>

<p>When any underground excavation is made in an already weak rock, it
often serves to further weaken the rock above it. This is due to a combination
of 1) the excavation activity itself (primarily blasting) weakening the
surrounding rocks as a result of shock waves and 2) the removal of supporting
rock from underneath a large mass of rock. The net effect of this, weakening
of rock and also giving it a place to go, is a movement toward the tunnel
from above, which wraps around the tunnel and forms wedges of material
which press in on the sides of the tunnel (Terzaghi, 1946) As Figure 4
illustrates, the rock in area abcd, loosened by the excavation, is attempting
to move downward, and is being resisted by friction on surfaces ac and
bd. The effect of this is the transfer of a large amount of the overburden,
W<sub>1</sub>, onto the abutments of the tunnel. This tunnel will require
steel supports, and they will be supporting a load equivalent to Hp, which
will depend on the characteristics of the rock mass and the dimensions
of the tunnel.</p>

<p>As was mentioned earlier, tunnels are sometimes cut with flat roofs
when excavated in strongly laminated rock, in order to take advantage of
the rock's tendency to separate on those planes. However, it is rarely
the case that laminated rocks are found in a pristine state with their
bedding planes parallel and horizontal. Inclined bedding planes in stratified
rocks pose a great problem, in that there is a great tendency for the rock
to move along the bedding planes and thus slide into the tunnel, as as
indicated in Figure 5, modified from Terzaghi (1946). The steep angle of
the bedding planes with respect to the tunnel will result in the wedge-shaped
rock body (aed) sliding into the tunnel and putting stress on the support
(ac). The lateral force, P, can be estimated from the mass of the sliding
rock body and the angle which it makes with the tunnel support. According
to King (1996), the load on the tunnel and supports depends on the strike
and dip of the strata, and tunnels will have to be cut more narrowly in
the event of steeply inclined stratified rocks.</p>

<center><p>Figure 5. Forces acting on a tunnel in inclined strata</p></center>

<p>In general, rocks have a high resistance to crushing. King (1996) states
that the walls of a tunnel will not fail as a result of compression except
at great depth - more than 2000 feet (600 m) for softer sandstones and
more than 19,000 feet (5800 m) for the strongest rocks. However, the rocks
are still under an immense amount of stress, and the rock left standing
after tunnel or cavern excavation must bear a greater load than before,
as illustrated in Figure 4 from Terzaghi. This point is further illustrated
in Figure 6, from Herget (1988). The grid lines represent the principal
plane-strain stresses around a circular tunnel after excavation. The crowding
of the trajectories at the sides indicates an increase in compression,
and the widening at the top and bottom indicates a decrease in compressive
stress. This implies that the walls of a tunnel, not the roof, would be
more susceptible to failure. This is the mechanical basis of the <a href="http://www-personal.umich.edu/~stmarie/kolar.gif">rockburst</a>
phenomenon.</p>

<p>Of all the hazards associated with mining, rockbursts are perhaps the
most terrifying. A rockburst is the sudden, violent dislocation of slabs
of rock in a tunnel, usually from the walls, but also potentially from
the roof or even floor. Considered to be a "mining-induced seismic
event," a rockburst can release enormous amounts of energy, and some
have been measured at 4 on the Richter scale (Jha and Chouhan, 1994) and
one rockburst was recorded by a seismological station 1200 miles distant.
(Obert and Duvall, 1967) The danger is obvious and quantifiable: In a three-year
period in the Kolar gold-field in India, rockbursts accounted for 50% of
all fatalities. (Obert and Duvall, 1967) The above link (blue "rockburst")
illustrates the before and after of a rockburst in the Kolar gold-field.
(Whittaker, et. al., 1992)</p>

<p>What are the causes of rockburst? One of the primary causes is obviously
stress. The forces necessary to shatter tons of rock require the input
of stress. The other primary factor is the rock type. An interesting point
about rock bursts is that they do not occur in weak rocks. It is thought
that the pressures which can cause a rockburst are slowly released in the
weaker rocks by semiplastic adjustments. (Wahlstrom, 1973) The rocks affected
are nearly always hard, strong, and brittle. These rocks may have an unconfined
compressive stress of 15,000 to 60,000 psi (100-400 MPa) and a Young's
modulus (modulus of elasticity) of 6x10^6 to 14x10^6 psi (40,000 to 90,000
MPa) (Obert and Duvall, 1967) In the United States, the most common location
for rockburst phenomena seems to be the Coeur d'Alene mining district of
northern Idaho, where the galena mines run over a mile deep into the quartzites
of the Revett Formation of the Belt Supergroup.</p>

<p>Mathematically, it can be shown that the strain energy per unit volume,
defined as the (normal stress)<sup>2</sup>/2E, where E is the Young's modulus,
or the ratio of stress to strain. The maximum strain energy per unit volume
would be C<sub>0</sub>/2E, where C<sub>0</sub> is the uniaxial compressive
stress. (Obert and Duvall, 1967) All other things being equal, the weakest
rocks would be the least likely to burst, because they would reach their
failure point far before they could store enough strain energy to produce
a violent failure.</p>

<p>It appears that the lithostatic pressure of depth is not in general
sufficient to produce the amount of stress necessary for a rockburst. What
appears to also be required is a mechanism for producing a localized increase
of the stress of the rock. The possibilities are numerous, including dike
intrusion, faulting, and many others. Figure 7, taken from Wahlstrom (1973),
illustrates three of the many possibilites. The quartzites of the Revett
Formation in the Coeur d'Alene mining district are stressed by a myriad
of faults, two of which (the right-lateral strike-slip Osburn and Placer
Creek faults) trace for over 100 kilometers. (Wallace, et. al., 1980, Swanson,
1992)</p>

<center><p><img src="./Tunnelling_ Mechanics, methods, and mistakes_files/fig7.gif" height="204" width="369"></p></center>

<p>Once the major conditions are met, rockbursts still require a mechanism
for failure. Germanovich, et. al. (1994) and Nemat-Nasser and Horii (1982)
describe a mechanism by which a crack, initially inclined to the principal
stresses, will grow in the direction of the principal stresses. This so-called
"crack kinking" is shown in Figure 8 below, with both an inclined
crack which has kinked as well as a pore which has begun cracking under
stress.</p>

<center><p><img src="./Tunnelling_ Mechanics, methods, and mistakes_files/crack.gif" height="237" width="443"></p></center>

<center><p>Figure 8. Cracks propagating from a) pre-existing flaw and b)
pore</p></center>

<p>In the presence of a free surface (in this case, the tunnel wall), the
cracks growing parallel to the free surface are affected by the free surface,
and grow unstably after reaching a certain length. (Dyskin and Germanovich,
1993a) This instability of crack propagation can result in the separation
of thin layers of rock from the rock mass and produce spalling. (Germanovich,
et. al., 1994) In a way, each individual crack can be looked upon as a
stress concentration. By itself, a single crack probably won't be responsible
for a failure, but through the stress-induced crack growth, interaction
of the cracks may cause the rock to reach a level of instablility where
it will fail.</p>

<p>As observed by Nemat-Nasser and Horii (1982) in their experiments with
compression of resin, the presence of a free surface had the effect of
inducing crack-kinking away from the free surface. The cracks then followed
(more or less) the free-surface contour. In rock, this would have the effect
of forming slabs of rock parallel to the wall, which may then buckle or
explosively break in a rockburst. (Nemat-Nasser and Horii, 1982) <a href="http://www-personal.umich.edu/~stmarie/nemat.gif">click

<p>Rockbursts are, however, mining-induced events. Were it not for the
removal of rock, the rock mass would stay perfectly happy at depth. Excavation
causes a large stress gradient and the potential for release of the rock's
stored strain energy. The rate of release of the strain energy is important.
A gradual release may be perfectly safe, whereas the violent releases of
energy are what we call rockbursts. Figure 9, taken from Whittaker, et.
al. (1992) illustrates three different excavation sequences. Sequences
1 and 3 both result in the release of energy quickly, which makes them
more susceptible to rockburst than Sequence 3, which has a more uniformly
gradual release of energy. A great deal of mining research is directed
toward techniques which will allow the gradual release of strain energy
in rocks, and thus avoid rockburst.</p>

<center><p><b>Conclusion</b> </p></center>

<p>Excavation of tunnels in rock is a complicated, dangerous, and expensive
process. The mechanics of this can be very complex. However, in the case
of excavation into rock which has a certain degree of competence, approximations
can be made that will allow for simplification of the mathematics, at least
in the preliminary design phase, which will allow for the simple calculation
of the feasibility of the project. In the actual design of the tunnel,
the more complex mathematical models would be used, and with a number of
computer application programs, be much quicker and more accurate than in
the past, ensuring the excavation of a safe and stable tunnel.</p>
