Better by the pound 10/10\n\n### Swiss Emmentaler\n  - Dry, rubbery, very firm. Has little taste but hints at being sweet and nutty. Good for melting 10/10\n\n### Caveman Blue\n  - Blue cheese BUT aged w/ cheese crystals. Eat within 2 days as the freshness falls off fast 10/10\n\n### Truffle Tremor\n  - Aged goat cheese blended with truffle oil. Excellent with beef. 10/10\n"
