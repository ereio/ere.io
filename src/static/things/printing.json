This caused a bit of confusion as tutorials made it sound as though space was needed between a 0.02mm piece of paper and the extruder\n - Filament was tangled while I was attempting to feed it without first having tightened the feed clamp\n\n##### After Thoughts\n - [Bed Leveling Calibation](https://i.imgur.com/tbvOlB9.jpg)\n - Use Cura for next print instead of animal model from SDCard\n - Use benchy for confirming the printer can handle whatever and is calibrated\n\n#### Potential DIY Printer Stack\n\n* Boards\n  * Mega Arduino w/ RAMPS\n  * RAMBo mini (RepRap Arduino-compatible Mother Board)\n  * [EINSY RAMBo](https://www.printedsolid.com/products/einsy-rambo-1-1)\n* [Firmware](https://reprap.org/wiki/List_of_Firmware)\n  * Marlin\n  * RAMPS (?)\n\nRAMBo boards are based on Arduino, most probably are.\n\n\n### Print List\n - [benchy](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:763622)\n - [ya boi baby yoda]()\n - [nanoleaf replicas](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3230905) [(or one without arduino?)](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3354082)"
