Using Alpine imo is eco friendly, cute, and generally really efficient compared to other popular distros.\n\nRpi install\n\n#### Format with fdisk\n```\nfdisk /dev/sdb\no # set to dos partition table\nn # new partition\nenter #default for first seg\nenter #default last seg\nt\nb # hex value for WIN FAT32 \na # bootable\n```\n\n#### Create filesystem\n```\nmkdosfs -F 32 /dev/sdb1\n# or\nmkfs.vfat -F 32 /dev/sdb1\n```"
