  "notes": "## Open Router\n\n### Rpi With OpenWrt\n```\n\n```\n\nI've used this setup for a little over 4 years now. Originally, the setup consisted of a LTE Modem bridged to the raspberry pi over ethernet, and several access points attached via usb. When connected to t-mobile, I could get around 10-20mb down. Over the course of 4 years, openwrt on Rpi was fairly stable for basic configuration. The moment I started adding a tethered android device, or dropping the ESSID of one of the access points, my connection would drop. Openwrt would be in a kernel panic boot loop.\n\nAlso sent openwrt into a boot loop changing the AP LEDs. That one hurt the most.\n\nI built up quite a bit of resources I would like to offload just in case.\n\n#### [Changing the TTL to spoof cell traffic](https://www.linuxtopia.org/Linux_Firewall_iptables/x4799.html) \n#### [More TTL examples in DD-WRT docs](https://wiki.dd-wrt.com/wiki/index.php/Iptables#Modifying_the_TTL)\n#### [Installing necessary RT drivers on openwrt](https://forum.openwrt.org/t/how-install-rtl8812au-driver-on-raspberry-pi-3-with-lede/4093/3)\n\nI have an instruction set I'll list out here with time.\n\n### Rpi with Raspbian lite\n\n  "
