  "notes": "## Open Router\n\n### Rpi With OpenWrt\n```\n\n```\n\nI've used this setup for a little over 4 years now. Originally, the setup consisted of a LTE Modem bridged to the raspberry pi over ethernet, and several access points attached via usb. When connected to t-mobile, I could get around 10-20mb down. \n\nOver the course of 4 years, openwrt on Rpi was fairly stable for basic configuration. The moment I started adding a tethered android device, or dropping the ESSID of one of the access points, my connection would drop. Openwrt would be in a kernel panic boot loop. Also sent openwrt into an unrecoverable boot loop changing the AP LED config. That one hurt the most.\n\nI built up quite a bit of resources I would like to offload just in case.\n\n#### [Changing the TTL to spoof cell traffic](https://www.linuxtopia.org/Linux_Firewall_iptables/x4799.html) \n#### [More TTL examples in DD-WRT docs](https://wiki.dd-wrt.com/wiki/index.php/Iptables#Modifying_the_TTL)\n#### [Installing necessary RT drivers on openwrt](https://forum.openwrt.org/t/how-install-rtl8812au-driver-on-raspberry-pi-3-with-lede/4093/3)\n#### [Installing Other RT drivers](https://forum.openwrt.org/t/raspberry-3-lan-wan-help-needed/1377/7)\n\n```\nopkg update\nopkg install kmod-usb-net-rtl8152\nreboot\n```\n\nI have an instruction set I'll list out here with time. \n\nAll in all,  the ease of use LuCI interface + hardware resource efficiency was really nice to have. When myself or others wanted to make quick changes, it was easy. Unfortunately, the inability to modify anything without the fear of kernel panics and boot loops made it moot.\n\n### Rpi with Raspbian lite\n\n  "
