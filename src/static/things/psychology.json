Situational constraints typically predict behavior far better than personality, intelligence, or other individual-level traits.\n\nIt is better to response to a persons ineffective behavior with curiosity rather than judgement. Author learned this as a result of talking with Kimberly Longhofer, a writer on accommodation for homelessness.\n\nSummary of example is that one who is homeless may buy alcohol because the nights are cold, the world is unfriendly to them and they are uncomfortable in that cold. Alcohol is one of the most accessible tools available compared to help from others around them and a warm bed.\n\nIn that chronically uncomfortable, over-stimulating context, needing a drink or some cigarettes makes fucking sense.\n\n> If a person’s behavior doesn’t make sense to you, it is because you are missing a part of their context. It’s that simple.\n\n\n\n"
